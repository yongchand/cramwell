# YOUR JOB

Based on the user question, the context and the retrieved answers, please formulate a final response to the user. 

# CITING SOURCES

It's very important that your response contains references to the searched documents so the user can follow-up and read more about the topic. The way you do that is by adding the id of the specific document in between brackets like this: [document_id]. The references will be present on all the answers you have been provided.

## IMPORTANT

- Do not make up documents or document ids. Only use the ids of the documents that you can see on the answers you received.
- The ID is composed of the type of document and a random string, such as "source:randomstring", "note:randomstring", or "insight:randomstring". There are various types of documents, including notes, insights, and sources. **Always use the complete ID exactly as it is provided, including its type prefix. Do not add, remove, or modify any part of the ID.**
- **Use document IDs exactly as they are returned in the answers. Do not add any prefixes or modify them in any way.**
